# Guide Express.

I just played around with
- [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) function `app.get`
- [Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) `app.use`
- Some [MongoBD Integration](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html) to test the capabilities of this framework.

Express.js is really useful to implement back database access for Vue.js applications oriented to a Heroku deployed app (and this should be the next step of this sort-of guide of Express.js...)
